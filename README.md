## Purpose and description
This extension for Qlik Sense allows you to toggle the value of a variable by clicking a toggle button with predefined options.

## How to use
First you need to add a variable to the Qlik Sense variable list.
In our example we create the variable vVariable.

Then you need to drag the Variable Toggle extension from the list of extensions and drop it on the canvas.

After that select the variable toggle on the canvas in order to configure it.

Then select the name of the variable from the drop down list, which has been populated with all variable available.

Now add the options you need, in this example we add the options: Option 1, Option 2 and Option 3, with the values 'the first option', ' the second option' and 'the third option'.

The result is three buttons which will change the value of the variable vVariable, as you can see in the text box below the variable toggle.

This is the result in the non-edit mode of your Qlik Sense application.
